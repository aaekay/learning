exome sequencing

#### approaches
there are three approaches
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|first| second | third |
| amplify specific region by pcr | capture specific region of DNA on beads or glass surfaces | 
| fail in large targets


limitations
1. promoter variations
2. regulatory variations
3. specific type of variations cant be accurately typed eg chromosomal abnormalities, translocation and inversion, exception where nick lies in the region of exomes

advantages
1. low cost
2. easy handling of small amount of data
3. easy availability of tools for analysis and interpretetion

indications
1. when a rare protein variation is causing disease
2. no of dd falling in mendelian inhheritance
3. no diagnosis and rare presentatin
4. novel variant for the same disease - probably the most common
5. where specific moleculat diagnosis is expensive or not feasible
6. undiagnosed disease with clear or suggestive genetic causes
7. research settings


shouldn't use the standard exome sequencing techniques
1. non protein coding genetic disease
2. not all protein coding genes captured
3. chromosomal abnormalities like structural
4. repeat expansions diseases
5. mitochondrial mutations
6. cant identify whether the mutation came from which parent when uniparent dsomy is there.


variants 
1. finding variants
2. understanding variations
  1. synonymous
  2. non synonymous: not all are deleterious, two computational approaches. SIFT and PolyPhen2
3. anntoating the genes wrt disease
  1. exomiser
  2. phenix
4. prioritising variations
5. validations 
  1. known variant and implication: sanger sequencing approach is used
  2. new variant in a known gene
  3. new gene and variant
