    "# Properties of a test\n",
    "### Validity\n",
    "validity is defined as the property of being true, corrent and in conformity with reality. It can be subdivided into different levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "| S no. | types of validity | desscritpion |\n",
    "| ------| ------------------| -------------|\n",
    "| 1     |     face validity | address user's opinion about functionality and realism of a test|\n",
    "| 2     | content vailidity | content of the test is suited to measure what it is supposed to measure |\n",
    "| 3     | construct validity| suited to measured the trait it is supposed to measure |\n",
    "| 4     | concurrent validity| comparison of test to a standard or another test that measures the same trait             |\n",
    "| 5     | predictive validity| extent to which a test predicts future perfomance |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability\n",
    "Reliability refers to whether a test is consistent in its outcome, which also affects validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently used items for reliability are:\n",
    "| internal consistency | inter rater relliabiliy | inter test reliability |\n",
    "| -------------------- | ------------------------| ---------------------- |\n",
    "| reflects the correlation between different items of test | agreement of scores of raters testing the same subject | agreement of scores when same test is taken twice | \n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is represented by a reliability coefficient(0.0 to 1.0)"
